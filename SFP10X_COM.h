    SFP10X_COM.h
 
 Abstract:
    The SFP10X_COM library defines a set of functions to facilitate serial
    communication with SFP products (for more details on SFP products refer to
    the relevant datasheets).
 
    Sendyne SFP product family:
    http://sendyne.com/Products/Sendyne%20Sensing%20Family.html
 
    Refer to the README.md file for usage instructions.
 
    The SFP10X_COM libary requires the FTDI FTD2XX driver library:
    http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm
