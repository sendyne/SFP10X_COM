All values coming from the library are in HEX format and need\r\nprocessing to be human readable. A helper function is provided to take care of\r\nthe conversion of HEX data.\r\n\r\nFor more information, refer to the module specific datasheet (can be found at\r\n[Sendyne SFP products family][sfp_page]).\r\n\r\nTake a look at our [videos on using the SFP10X_COM library in NI LabView](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2tMAX1cpLJu92bLrU1GD6hDbyyS_E2VL).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n### Supported platforms\r\nThe SFP10X_COM library is designed to be used on the following platforms:\r\n\r\n* Microsoft Windows (XP or above),\r\n* Apple OS X (versions 10.9.X or above),\r\n* Linux Ubuntu and derivatives.\r\n\r\n### FTDI D2XX driver\r\nThe SFP10X_COM library requires a functional installation of the\r\n[FTDI D2XX][ftdi_d2xx_link] driver library.\r\n\r\nRefer to [D2XX webpage][ftdi_d2xx_link] for installation instructions and\r\ndocumentation.\r\n\r\nNote that, on OS X and Linux platforms the FTDI D2XX library has special\r\nrequirements to operate properly; see the following documentation:\r\n\r\n* [OS X D2XX installation guide][ftdi_mac_an],\r\n* [Linux D2XX installation guide][ftdi_linux_an].\r\n\r\nWe recommend that, prior to using the SFP10X_COM library, the user check its\r\nFTDI D2XX installation by compiling and running the examples shipped with the\r\nD2XX library.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Compilation\r\nSFP10X_COM is pure C and should compile with most available compilers (Visual\r\nStudio, GCC, Clang, ...).\r\n\r\nThe SFP10X_COM library can be used in two ways:\r\n\r\n* by adding the header and source file to the user project and including them\r\n  in the build process,\r\n* by building a library and linking the user project against it.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, the user needs to provide the location of the FTDI D2XX header\r\nfiles, and to link against the FTDX D2XX library (either statically or\r\ndynamically).\r\n\r\n### Notes for Microsoft Windows platforms\r\nA Windows module-definition file (SFP10X\\_COM.def) is provided with the\r\nSFP10X_COM library in order to properly build a DLL version of the library.\r\n\r\nA DLL and static version of SFP10X_COM library are provided in\r\n[compiled_win](compiled_win/).\r\n\r\n### Notes for OS X platforms\r\nCompilation on OS X platforms requires additional linking:\r\n\r\n* the user needs to link against the CoreFoundation and IOKit frameworks\r\n  (`-framework CoreFoundation -framework IOKit`),\r\n* the user needs to link against the libobjc library (`-lobjc`).\r\n\r\nIn addition, as explained in the [FTDI Application Note AN_134][ftdi_mac_an]\r\nregarding the possible conflicts with Apple's own FTDI driver, FTDI driver and\r\nthe FTDI D2XX library, the user might need to manually unload kernel\r\nextensions for the SFP10X_COM library to work properly (see commands\r\n`kextstat` and `kextunload`).\r\n\r\n### Notes for Linux platforms\r\nCompilation on Linux platforms requires additional linking:\r\n\r\n* the user needs to link against pthread and dl libraries (`-lpthread -ldl`).\r\n\r\nIn addition, similar to OS X platforms, some kernel modules need to unloaded\r\nto allow the FTDI D2XX library to bind to the device. Those kernel modules are\r\n`ftdi_sio` and `usbserial`. Refer to the\r\n[FTDI D2XXdocumentation][ftdi_linux_an] for more details. Finally, executables\r\nshould be run with elevated privileges (using the `sudo` command).\r\n\r\n### C# wrapper ###\r\nA [C# wrapper](CSharp_wrapper/) for the SFP10X_COM library is also provided to\r\nfacilitate integration with Visual C# and .NET projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Example\r\nThe file [main.c](main.c) illustrates the functionalities provided by the\r\nSFP10X_COM library.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\nMIT License (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\nBug reports and pull requests welcome!\r\n\r\n[sfp_page]: http://www.sendyne.com/Products/Sendyne%20Sensing%20Family.html\r\n[ftdi_d2xx_link]: http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm\r\n[ftdi_mac_an]: http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/AppNotes/AN_134_FTDI_Drivers_Installation_Guide_for_MAC_OSX.pdf\r\n[ftdi_linux_an]: http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/AppNotes/AN_220_FTDI_Drivers_Installation_Guide_for_Linux%20.pdf\r\n\r\n",
